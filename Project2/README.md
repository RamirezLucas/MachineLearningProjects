# Project Road Segmentation

Our big Project has started! I'm trying to make things less hazardous as last time. Following some simple rules we can spare a lot of time and make things go much quicker.

## Last Work Done

- `[Philippe]` Create a nice Markdown README
- `[Philippe]` Trying to keep trace of the work done (This two can be deleted, just an exemple haha)
- `[Philippe]` Extracted all the functions of `segment_aerial_image.ipynb` to a script `segment_aerial_image.py` for reusing purpose.
- `[Philippe]` Made a _getting_used_to_ workspace to do the same process done as in `segment_aerial_image.ipynb`
- `[Philippe]` Added an `image_processing.py` script for some openCV image manipulation.
- `[Manuel]` Added an `preprocess.py` script for some image manipulation (resizing images, converting to the same format, cropping image into patches)
- `[Manuel]` Modified the `helper.py` script in order to convert all images to either float32 or uint8, as the different datasets have different types for their pixels.

## Questions

- `[Philippe]` How will they evaluate our work?
- `[Philippe]` Should we process in patches like in the example or pixel by pixel.

## Todo list

- `[x]` Create a nice Markdown README
- `[ ]` Get the knowledge for the project (Make simple tests)
- `[ ]` Make a task list for everyone!
- `[x]` Trying to be organized

## Suggestions

 > _**Philippe**_ \
 A Markdown [Cheat Sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

 > _**Philippe**_ \
 I would suggest everyone uses Visual Studio Code as it makes things really using the jupyter lab interpreter addon, edditing markdowns really easy etc..

 > _**Philippe**_ \
 This formatting looks great no? Try to follow it, it makes things clear!
